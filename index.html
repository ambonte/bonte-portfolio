          <h2>DEFENSE ESSAY</h2>
          <p>My names are Bana Bonte Emma. From my childhood, I was always fascinated by the growth of the tech industry. Therefore, I chose to enroll in Information Systems at Davis College. My dream is to be a software engineer in the future. I am a highly motivated person and always work hard for better results. Throughout my student life and work experience, I have been relied upon as the one with detail-oriented and innovative ideas and I always wanted to work in a sustainable environment. The following are the reasons why I deserve a software engineering internship in your company. <br><br>

            I believe that I deserve this internship because first of all I am a hardworking person and a problem solver. Over the last year as a student at Davis College in Information Systems, I acquired skills and knowledge that you can need in your company. I have skills in web development, java, data structures and algorithms and networking. In addition, I have gained leadership and business skills from the courses that we have taken as I can now manage my emotions effectively. Therefore, my ultimate goal is to apply what I have learned at school and learn new things from your company, thus improving my career. <br><br>
            
            The second reason why I deserve this scholarship is because I have an experience as an apprentice in the Wecode Rwanda, a tech vocational school. Through wecode, I had the chance of spending 6 months learning and I became a full stack developer with skills in javascript, flask and django. In addition, I also participated in a training program of Andela where I was trained as a frontend developer. Now, I can build a website, host it and debug in case there are errors in the codes. I can also act as a scrum master because I always led teams in my apprenticeship program. Therefore, having me in your company can be a great opportunity for you to explore me and all my experiences. <br><br>
            
            In conclusion, I am a goal oriented person who is interested in the tech industry and my dream is to become a software developer in the future. Therefore, I would like to become an intern in your company. I believe that I am the best candidate because I have skills in web development, can work as a scrum master and have both leadership and business skills that I gained from school and the apprenticeship. I hope you will consider my application and allow me to show you what I am capable of while learning from you at the same time. <br>

            <h4>7 Habits of successful developers</h4>
            
            <p><em>Success is not an overnight trip but a long journey of hard work and dedication. To make your mark in the software development industry, you have to be passionate about coding and should be ready to go to any extent to improve yourself. Even if it requires you to change the very core of your habits, you should be prepared for that.

              This is what every successful developer does. Here, let us discuss seven most impactful habits of successful developers that you can follow to reach the top of your career.
              
              1. Writing clean code
              The first good habit that has the potential to make you a successful developer is to write a clean code. You can follow any coding standard you like but make sure your code is human readable. Technology is changing very rapidly and there may be instances when your code needs improvements or tweaks. So, make your code maintainable enough that others can also make changes to your code whenever needed in the future.
              
              2. Learning continuously
              The phenomenon of ‘the survival of the fittest’ works in the software ecosystem too. To survive in this competitive world, you need to continuously improve yourself. Employers today want their workforce to be up-to-date with industry standards and software technologies. Thus, to keep pace with the advancements, you can join skill enhancement programs, online trainings, read tutorials, watch videos, etc. Upskilling yourself will definitely be a turning point in your career as a software developer.
              
              3. Discipline and Persistence
              Discipline and persistence are other success-oriented habits that every developer should adapt to. Being disciplined helps you finish your task-in-hand on time. Persistence, on the other hand, is another virtue of successful developers that strengthen them to beat all odds and complete their work before the deadline hits no matter what the hurdles they are facing.
              
              4. Knowing their forte
              Not everyone is made for doing everything. You may be good at developing UI and UX but may not be an expert at developing the back-end of an application. Successful software developers know their forte and work around that to succeed in whatever they do.
              
              5. Open for new things
              To meet a client’s expectation, a developer may be required to go an extra mile in researching and exploring the every aspect of technology. It is said that “Impossible” is not a word in a developer’s dictionary once the requirement document is closed. Successful developers follow this rule by their heart and that is the quality which eventually makes them successful.
              
              6. Paying attention to details
              Any successful developer can tell you that to write a perfect code or to complete a project successfully, you need to pay attention to the details of the client requirement and work accordingly. You would not want to work on a piece of code again and again because of a small semicolon that you forgot to add while terminating a line of code. Thus, keep your eyes open and attend every small detail of the code and the project as a whole to be in the category of successful developers.
              
              7. Having end product in mind all the time
              You cannot hit a target you cannot see. It is imperative for you to set clear goals of where you are headed toward and what you really want at the end of your project. If you start developing a project keeping this mantra in your mind, there is no way you won’t succeed as a developer.</em></p>

            <h4>My experience of learning HTML and CSS.</h4>
            
            <p><em>When I start thinking of learning HTML, I even don’t know what to learn , Although I wanted to learn. So I browse what is this simple programming language HTML and CSS ? I found it easily but it was not tough to remember their full form.
              My first question is from where should I start to learn ?
              To that question I will share my experience, so the first thing that we as a beginners do is- we start browsing on the internet, say one hour or two then we read all the resources, whatever we find and try hard to get to the conclusion so that we can plan and be motivated but we are quite blur. We will then realise that it is better to start practice from free websites. After sometime, motivation is gone. We are out of focus , we started thinking it’s not possible to learn, then we might look around more in YouTube. I will recommend to some extent if you are learning alone as a beginner we can get some of the best resources and motivations from YouTube and Medium blog.
              Which is the best source ? Well, I start learning from free resources like YouTube and free websites and I stick to that resources and if I am in doubt I refer other material but I need to understand what is given in that, so that I write the code that I understand or say clean code. We can use some paid resources too. So the most important thing is -we need to have a goal for each day and stick to that. Don’t feel demotivated.
              Was It hard ? Yes, learning oneself is hard definitely, so to keep motivated we can tweet our progress, where many coders tweet. I am not recommending any material as I am not an expert to decide that which is good or better as we have different approach and the material available will not solve all the problems that one face while coding, so referring to one material may be good in knowing and approaching a particular problem to solve.
              Finally, there is a map if anyone wants to become Web Developer, i.e Front-end Web Developer and Back-end developer. After knowing the road map, do not feel disheartened that there are many topics to learn, sure it is hard but we have to take one step at a time, the journey is rewarding in each step, trust me, I am enjoying the journey which I think is much more important than the destination.
              Front-end developer’ s road map:

            <h4>Do Something You Love And You’ll Never Work A Day In Your Life</h4>
            
            <p><em>I remember reading this quote a few times and never thinking much of it. Growing up I never had any idea of what I wanted to do. This continued as I got older and graduated from university. I still had no clue about which path I wanted to take.
              I ended up travelling and doing a lot of work in the construction industry. I thought this may be something that I would enjoy doing. I get a lot of satisfaction from building things, but working on construction is truly hard work.
              Could I do that for the rest of my life?
              It was a question I couldn’t answer. As luck would have it, I decided to start a travel blog after being unable to find information on somewhere I was going.
              While it was tough going at first, I was able to slowly build up some momentum with the blog after a while. It was during these early periods and later on when I came home from working in the office that I realised how much I enjoyed working on the blog.
              I got an immense amount of satisfaction from writing a post and seeing it perform well on Google. It was at this moment that I realised I didn’t consider the blog work. I thoroughly enjoyed sitting down and doing hard work, even though it didn’t feel like hard work.
              I realised the value of the above quote in these moments. Not all of us can do what we enjoy for a living. However, I think the main reason for this is that a lot of us don’t know what we enjoy doing when it comes to working. A large reason for this is that we neglect to do hard work when it matters the most.
              If you start a passion project but give up halfway through because you aren’t seeing results, you will never know what could have been. The pain of regret will always be there.
